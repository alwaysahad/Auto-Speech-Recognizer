    <h1>Auto-Speech-Recognizer (ASR)</h1>
    <p>The Auto-Speech-Recognizer (ASR) project focuses on transforming raw audio into a sequence of corresponding words. ASR, also known as Speech-to-Text (STT), plays a crucial role in various speech-related tasks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Speaker Diarization:</strong> Determines which speaker spoke when during an audio recording.</li>
        <li><strong>Speaker Recognition:</strong> Identifies and distinguishes different speakers.</li>
        <li><strong>Spoken Language Understanding:</strong> Extracts meaning from spoken language.</li>
        <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Analyzes the emotional tone of the speaker.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Key Components of ASR:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acoustics Variability:</strong> Deals with differences in speakers (inter-speaker) and variations within the same speaker (intra-speaker). Factors include noise, reverberation, and environmental conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Phonetics and Linguistics:</strong> Handles articulation, elisions, and word variations. Considers the size of the vocabulary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Challenges in ASR:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High-Dimensional Output Space:</strong> Mapping audio to text involves a complex sequence-to-sequence problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Annotated Training Data:</strong> ASR models require substantial training data, which can be scarce.</li>
        <li><strong>Noise and Variability:</strong> Real-world audio is noisy and contains various sources of variability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall, ASR bridges the gap between spoken language and text, enabling applications like voice assistants, transcription services, and more.</p>
